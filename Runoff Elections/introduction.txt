 A runoff election is a ranked-choice voting system. In a ranked-choice system, voters can vote for more than one candidate. Instead of just voting for their top choice, 
 they can rank the candidates in order of preference. 
 
 In an instant runoff election, voters rank all candidates. If any candidate has a majority (more than 50%) of the first preference votes, that candidate is declared the 
 winner of the election.
 
If no candidate has more than 50% of the vote, then an “instant runoff” occurrs. The candidate who received the fewest number of votes is eliminated from the election, and 
anyone who originally chose that candidate as their first preference now has their second preference considered. The process repeats a candidate with majority is found,which is
then declared the winner
 
Corner cases:
One possibility is that there’s a tie for who should get eliminated. We handle that scenario by saying all candidates who are tied for last place will be eliminated given
that not every candidate has the exact same number of votes- because that would mean eliminating everyone).In such a case we declare a tie between all remaining candidates.
