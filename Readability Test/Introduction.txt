A project which aims to determine what (U.S.) grade level is needed to understand a given text. 

The program uses the the Coleman-Liau index for the readability test.
The formula is:  

     index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8 
    
 Here, L: is the average number of letters per 100 words in the text
       S: is the average number of sentences per 100 words in the text
